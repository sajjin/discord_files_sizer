**Bypass Discord's file size limits by hosting files on your private server!**

Upload files of **any size** to Discord and automatically store them on your own server. Bot creates beautiful rich embeds with download links.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Unlimited file sizes** - No Discord limits! (configurable, default 5GB)
- 💎 **Rich embeds** - Professional looking file cards in Discord
- 🔗 **Dual upload methods** - Normal Discord upload OR `/upload` command
- 🖼️ **Image previews** - Thumbnails show inline
- 🎬 **Video support** - One-click to view
- 🗑️ **Automatic cleanup** - Files auto-delete after 30 days (configurable)
- 🔒 **Private server** - Your files, your control
- 📦 **Docker deployment** - Easy setup with Docker Compose
- 🛡️ **Cloudflare Zero Trust** - Secure public access
- ⚡ **Automatic processing** - Intercepts normal Discord uploads
- 🎯 **Direct upload** - Web interface bypasses Discord entirely

---

## 🎬 How It Works

### Method 1: Normal Discord Upload (Automatic)
```
User drags file to Discord → Bot intercepts → Uploads to YOUR server
→ Bot posts rich embed with download link → File stays on your server
```

### Method 2: `/upload` Command (Direct)
```
User types /upload → Bot sends private link → User uploads via web page
→ Bypasses Discord completely → Bot posts rich embed in channel
```

## Method A: if file is less then 100MB
The file will upload in whole all at once


## Method B: if file is more than 100MB
The file will be seperated into 50MB and sent in chunks and then reassebled by the server after a chunks recived this is to get by the 100 second timer for cloudflares zero trust tunnel on the free tier.
